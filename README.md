GUI and runnables for running the milling machine simulator locally

The latest version of the simulator is packaged and available for download from:
https://www.dropbox.com/s/1np9nqj53k48y6j/Simulator.zip?dl=0

To run the example (minimum 4GB of RAM):
1. Run "Milling Menu.bat"
2. Select option 3 or 4 depending on available RAM
3. Select the existing cylinders.db as the database
4. In the control panel select to run the CSV file in NCFiles folder
5. Check to see both 2D and 3D graphs.

All four repositories are part of Theocharis Alexopoulos' PhD thesis. If you are interested in the project or would like to integrate the simulator with a machining process feel free to contact me through LinkedIn (see link under my profile).
